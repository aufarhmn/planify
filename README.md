# PLANIFY
Planify is a desktop app that aims to enhance user productivity. Since Planify is focused on user, we develop a mood recommender algorithm. This algorithm will provide user on what to do with their task, such as do ask many tasks as you can or not doing many tasks at a different time based on user emotion. User will be prompted with several question related to their mood. This question can capture user mood accordingly. On Planify, you can manage your task, create notes, use calendar, set reminder after a specified time, and get notification for upcoming task.
